# SpaceX Launches

React app that fetches and displays data from the SpaceX API (https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) about past launches. 
The styling is mainly done with React-bootstrap components. 

The webiste currently uses a deprected version of the API that only contains launches until November 2020.
